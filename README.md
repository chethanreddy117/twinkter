🚀 Twinkter - A Mini Twitter Clone 🌟

I’ve built Twinkter, a lightweight Twitter clone using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Essentials. This project focuses on dynamic interactivity, showcasing the power of JavaScript in creating engaging user interfaces.

Key Features and Concepts:
Dynamic Tweet Handling:

Users can compose tweets with a simple input field and button (tweetInput, tweetBtn). The functionality is wired with event listeners to capture input and log actions.
Like and Retweet Functionality:

Clickable icons for likes and retweets, using methods like handleLikeClick() and handleRetweetClick() to update the data in real time.
The state management ensures toggling between liked/retweeted and their respective counters seamlessly.
Interactive Replies Section:

Each tweet dynamically displays its replies, structured with a getFeedHtml() method.
Using loops, JavaScript renders nested replies (repliesHtml) in a user-friendly format.
Efficient Rendering:

A render() function updates the feed content dynamically without reloading the page.
Utilizes concepts like DOM manipulation and template literals for efficient updates.
Data Management:

The project uses mock data from tweetsData for tweets, including properties like uuid, isLiked, and isRetweeted, providing a structured way to manage and modify tweet states.
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:

Event delegation to handle actions efficiently.
State-based rendering for real-time updates.
The synergy of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in building feature-rich apps.
